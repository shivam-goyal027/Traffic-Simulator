1. Building
    Build the expression evaluator using `make all` target. `make clean` target is also available.

2. Running the evaluator
    Execute the binary named calculate (`./calculate`) generated by `make all`.
    Then type an expression consisting of integers and +/* signs and end your expression with a '.' like so:
    1+2*3.

3. Go through each of the files carefully and try to understand the individual components. A high level idea:
    lexer.mll : The file specifies the the lexer that contains the regex rules for creating tokens for our language of expressions. (done)
    parser.mly: The file specifies the grammar for the language of expressions and created corresponding parse tree.
    expression.ml: Contains the type for our expression parse tree and corresponding evaluator and pretty print functions.
    evaluator.ml:  Top level REP loop that creates a shell to evaluate successive expressions.
